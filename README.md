<h2>Description: </h2>The main idea of the project is creating a web application that shown book collection, details of each book, information of best watched and top sold books. There are also other pages such as About, Contact Us, Register and Login page.

Even though the Register and Login page are not yet useful, but the idea is that the project can be scaled up to adding favourite book to the users' baskets as a to-buy items.
